        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>Welcome to Mogbomoya! The Mogbomoya App is an events (live and virtual) aggregator platform that connects people through their social interests and the lure of connectedness.

The registered place of business is at 9 Chijioke Akwukwuma Street, Lekki, Lagos 105102.
